# Immudb

[Immudb](https://immudb.io/) is a database created by Codenotary. As an immutable multi-model database that separates compute and storage, this is a pretty interesting project. This little collection of scripts and configuration is a byproduct of my learning process.

The kubernetes config in here is based on the config shown in [this blog post](https://immudb.io/blog/pushing-new-technology-the-hard-way-part2).
